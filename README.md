Introduction:
-------------
Food_cal is a Django-based web application designed for fitness enthusiasts. It offers features like tracking workouts, monitoring diet, setting fitness goals, and providing nutritional information. This application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

Prerequisites:
--------------
Before setting up Food_cal, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Django is a Python framework, so Python is necessary to run Django applications. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Setting Up Django:
------------------
To run a Django application, you need to have Django installed. Here are the steps to install Django:

1. Install Python: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your command prompt or terminal.

2. Install pip: Pip is a package manager for Python. If you have Python installed from python.org or via a Python installer, you should already have pip. You can check this by running `pip --version`.

3. Install Django: You can install Django using pip. In your command prompt or terminal, run the following command:

    ```
    pip install django
    ```

    This will download and install the latest Django version.

Setting Up Food_cal:
--------------------
Once Django is installed, you can set up the myFitBro application.

1. Download Food_cal: Clone or download the myFitBro repository from its source. If it's hosted on a platform like GitHub, you can use the following command:

    ```
    git clone [URL of the Food_cal repository]
    ```

2. Navigate to the myFitBro Directory: Change your directory to the myFitBro folder:

    ```
    cd food_cal
    ```

3. Run the Server: Start the Django development server:

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    By default, the server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
